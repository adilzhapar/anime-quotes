1,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,It is foolish to fear what we have yet to see and know.
2,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,It is not wise to judge others based on your own perceptions and by their
3,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,Growth occurs when one goes beyond one’s limits.
4,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,Even the strongest of opponents always have a weakness.
5,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"Teachings that do not speak of pain have no meaning, for humankind cannot gain anything in return."
6,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"Knowledge and awareness are vague, and perhaps better called illusions."
7,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"However strong you become, never seek to bear everything alone. If you do, failure is certain."
8,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,Change is impossible in this fog of ignorance.
9,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,Those who turn their heads against their comrades are sure to die a terrible death. Be prepared.
10,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"He who forgives and acknowledges himself, that is what it truly means to be strong!"
11,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,I never wanted to take out the Uchiha clan… But it was the only way to save my little brother.
12,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"Don’t cry Sasuke. Your big brother is here to protect you, no matter what happens."
13,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,That’s okay… Just as long as we can be together sometimes.
14,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,Once more just before I leave this world… I wish to hear him call me elder brother.
15,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,You and I are flesh and blood. I’m always going to be there for you even if it’s only as an obstacle for you to overcome. That’s what big brothers are for.
16,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"We are unique siblings. I am the barrier you must overcome, so you and I will continue to exist together."
17,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,You don’t have to forgive me… but no matter what happens to you from here on out… I will always love you…
18,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"You Will never have to forgive me. No matter what happens to you from here on out, I will always love you"
19,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,Forgive me Sasuke... It ends with this.
20,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"You aren't even worth killing, foolish little brother."
21,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"Foolish brother, if you wish to kill me - hate me, detest me, and survive in an unsightly way. Run..."
22,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,You're such a child. You talk of nothing but pipe dreams... there are times when people must make painful choices.
23,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,I always lied to you telling you to forgive me. I used these hands to keep you at distance… I did not want you to get involved. But now… I think you could have changed father and mother.
24,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"We do not know what kind of people we truly are until the moment before our deaths. As death comes to embrace you, you will realize what you are. That’s what death is, don’t you think?"
25,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,Those who turn their hands against their comrades are sure to die a terrible death.
26,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"People’s lives don’t end when they die, they end when they lose faith."
27,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony Shinobi’s blessing. But because I’m enlightened by my intelligence."
28,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,Any technique is worthless before my eyes.
29,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"No, it means to forgive yourself for what you aren’t able to do. Your comrades are there to make up for what you cannot do and to prevent you from ignoring things that you actually might have been able to do."
30,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"The village does have its dark side and its inconsistencies, but I’m still Konoha’s Itachi Uchiha."
31,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,I actually don’t think something like perfection exists. That is I think why we are born able to absorb things… and by comparing ourselves with something else we can finally head in a good direction.
32,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,No single thing is perfect by itself. That’s why we’re born to attract other things to make up for what we lack.
33,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"I’ll admit that you’re stronger than before. But because of that, you seem to have lost sight of what’s truly important. Now listen carefully. The people of the village, who once abhorred you, have begun to admire you. They think of you as a comrade. It’s because you fought hard for their acceptance. You once said it was everyone who cares about you who helped you get where you are now. If you forget others because you have power, and become arrogant and egotistical, you’ll eventually become just like Madara. No matter how powerful you become, do not try to shoulder everything alone. Becoming the Hokage doesn’t mean people will acknowledge you. But when the people acknowledge you, you can become Hokage. Never forget your friends."
34,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"It’s never been “The one who becomes Hokage will be acknowledged by everyone”, it’s “The one who is acknowledged by everyone, becomes the Hokage"
35,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,Self-sacrifice… A nameless shinobi who protects peace within its shadow. That is a true shinobi.
36,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"We are humans, not fish."
37,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"Those who cannot acknowledge themselves, will eventually fail."
38,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That’s how they define “reality.”
39,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"Obsessed with the organization, obsessed with the clan, obsessed with our lineage… A worthless compulsion that enslaves us and limits our capabilities, leading us to fear what you don’t understand."
40,Itachi,Naruto,Itachi,"So this time, for once, let me tell you one small truth."
41,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,Fear. That is what we live with. And we live it everyday. Only in death are we free of it.
42,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,"Hinata… this is the unalterable difference in strength… the distinction that separates the elite from the failure. This is the unchangeable reality. From the moment you said you wouldn’t run, your defeat was inevitable. The only possible outcome was your present despair… Withdraw!"
43,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,You are the strongest enemy I have ever fought.
44,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,No one can determine another’s destiny.
45,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,"The difference between stupidity and genius, is that genius has its limits."
46,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,So you’re not going to withdraw? Then don’t blame me for what happens to you.
47,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,The heavens will not allow a pawn who can only seek victory at the cost of himself to advance…
48,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,about Gai : “He’s so childish. He acts like a seven-year-old! ”
49,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,"about Lee and Gai: “As usual, I can’t keep up with their craziness. ”"
50,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,People share only one common fate… death.
51,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,Because Naruto… you saved me from the darkness.
52,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,"All this time I’ve been called a genius, so I cannot lose."
53,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,"Sasuke’s out there right now, heading toward Orochimaru. We can’t allow such evil to take someone from our village… that is not our way."
54,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,"Naruto… Sometimes, your eyes are even better than mine."
55,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,No one can determine another’s destiny. ” – Neji Hyuga
56,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,There’s no method but death to escape this horrible curse.
57,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,The curse represents a mark of the bird in a cage… It is… the symbol of being tied down to an inescapable destiny.
58,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,"to Naruto: “These eyes of mine show me many things. One thing they’ve shown me…people’s limitations are set, fixed, and unchangeable. Only a fool wastes his time trying to become something he can never be! ”"
59,Neji Hyuga,Naruto,Neji Hyuga,"Right now, Sasuke is in the darkness. The only one who can save him is you, Naruto."
60,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,A soul needs a purpose to live and so I concluded that my purpose was to kill everyone besides myself. I felt alive.
61,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"Naruto, just so you know, there will be a war to protect the Eight-tails and Nine-tails. In other words, you."
62,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"He knew pain like I did, and then he taught me that you can change your path."
63,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"If love is just a word, then why does it hurt so much if you realize it isn’t there?"
64,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"We have walked through the darkness of this world, that’s why we are able to see even a sliver of light."
65,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"It’s too bad I don’t think of you as anything. If you get in my way, I’ll kill you."
66,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,Perhaps the companionship of an evil person is preferable to loneliness.
67,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,Family? Let me tell you what kind of link I have with them. They are just lumps of meat linked by hatred and murderous intent!
68,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,Peace under an illusion is not true peace. It’s only meaningful if the real world manages to accomplish it.
69,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,I want to be needed. This is what I’ve learned from meeting and fighting Uzumaki Naruto.
70,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"In order to escape a road of solitude, one has to work hard and forge a new path with their own power."
71,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"One day, I’d like to become something precious to others."
72,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"For the sake of the ninja world and as the Kazekage, I will guard you with my life."
73,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"I think of you as a friend. I used to think ‘friend’ was just another word—nothing more, nothing less. But when I met you, I realized what was important was the word’s meaning."
74,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"Now there’s something I understand a little better—hate, sadness, even joy."
75,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,People cannot win against their loneliness.
76,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"Up until now, my bonds with others have only been ones of hatred and murder, but seeing him fight so hard made me wonder what a bond really is."
77,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"Just because someone is important to you, it doesn’t necessarily mean that that person is good."
78,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"You’re the same then. When you feel the honor of your idol under scrutiny, you become enraged as if it were your own honor being questioned. The more precious your idol is to you, the harder you fight for him."
79,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"You can make a rain of 1,000 needles. I will make it rain blood."
80,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"There are no enemies here because we’ve all suffered at Akatsuki’s hand! So there is no Suna, no Iwa, no Konoha, no Kiri, and no Kumo! There are only shinobi!"
81,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,What does pain feel like?
82,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"You have the same eyes as I do—the eyes filled with hatred and death that long for strength, just like mine."
83,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,I finally understand. I’m alone. I won’t believe in anyone or love anyone. I’m alone.
84,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"I am a relic they want to get rid of, so why do I exist and live?"
85,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"I took the life of the woman I was supposed to call mother in the process of being born. In order to become the world’s strongest shinobi, I became the incarnation of sand."
86,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,Your eyes tell me how badly you wish to kill the one who put you through the hell called loneliness.
87,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,I shall kill you. I will not cease to exist.
88,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"We’ve fought world wars for our own nations, our own villages. We’ve hurt one another. We’ve hated one another. That hatred bred a lust for power, and that lust for power created me."
89,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,He was the one who taught me to deepen my bond with my people.
90,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"If all other people exist to magnify that love, then there is no more a splendid universe than this one."
91,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"Thanks to him, I was able to regain my true self."
92,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,I would love only myself and fight for only myself.
93,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"If you’re truly prepared to take up the mantle of a Kage, then as Sasuke’s friend, you know what you have to do."
94,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"This is where it all starts for me. Starting with this small bond. I too want to become someone who is needed, instead of a weapon that is feared."
95,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"That village has him—the one who cherishes a friend’s bond more than anyone I know. Naruto Uzumaki—knowing him and the friends he holds so dear, they will overcome this disaster and grow even stronger from it."
96,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,I know him well. He takes too many risks when it comes to his friends. That’s why.
97,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"I hated this world, and all the people in it. I wanted to destroy it with my own hands."
98,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"I was his enemy, yet he wept for me! I hurt him, yet he called me his friend! He saved me! My enemy, my fellow Jinchuuriki. He suffered the same pain as me, yet bore no ill will!"
99,Gaara,Naruto,Gaara,"Our enemies are after the friend who saved my life! If they take him, if we hand him over, our world is finished! I want to protect him, and I want to protect our world! But I’m too young to protect it all on my own! All of you lend me your aid!"
100,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,My dream doesn’t exist in the future. It lies in the past. That’s the only place it exists.
101,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,Why do you always treat me like such a pest?
102,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"Naruto, I know you’re special, but I am more special than you!"
103,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"Having too many bonds causes one to lose focus—weakening their strongest wish, their greatest desire."
104,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"What I have is not a dream, because I will make it a reality."
105,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"If that’s how it is, I’ll just have to sever that bond."
106,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"I hate a lot of things, and I don’t particularly like anything."
107,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,I’m trembling with excitement.
108,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,I’m going to restore my clan and kill a certain someone.
109,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"From now on, we just go our separate ways."
110,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,That which is destroyed can always be fixed and rebuilt.
111,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,First thing in the morning and they’re already driving me nuts.
112,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"I have told you before, I’m an avenger. I don’t care about this test, Chunin, or whatever. ‘Am I strong?’ That’s the answer I want."
113,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"Tears and rain fall down on my face. My body is unable to stay, yet my heart is unwilling to leave."
114,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,This is the path I walk. Not you or anyone can change that.
115,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"As for me, I have absolutely no reason to love her. And likewise, I can see no reason why she would love me."
116,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,I don’t know. My body just moved. There was no time to think.
117,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,The gap between us hasn’t narrowed in the slightest. Why?
118,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,I have long since closed my eyes. My only goal is in the darkness.
119,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"I understand now. Even if I must take the devil’s fruit, I must gain power. I am an avenger."
120,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"I know the four of us have worked together. And for a while, I thought I could choose that path instead. But in the end, I’ve decided on revenge. That’s always been my purpose of living."
121,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"Your laughing voices sound like contempt and mocking me now, I will change those laughs to screams and wails."
122,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"It’s too late, nothing you can say will change me!"
123,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"I’m going to kill you and every last person in your beloved village! It’s time to make your choice! Kill me and become a hero, or die at my hand and become another one of my victims!"
124,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"Don’t worry, this will be over in five seconds."
125,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"If anyone who criticizes my way of life were to come forward, I’d turn around and kill every single one of their loved ones, so that they, too, can grasp what it’s like to experience this hatred of mine."
126,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,To accept and adopt Itachi’s intention would be childish.
127,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,Like I’d die. I won’t die. The reason Itachi lived for—I can’t—I won’t let it end here.
128,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,I’m not the same as you. I’m travelling a path the rest of you can’t follow.
129,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,Loneliness—you can’t compare it to what you feel after you get scolded by your parents.
130,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,I never want to see another important person die in front of me again.
131,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,I will acknowledge that you are strong because you are someone who knows the same pain of loneliness as I do; and that pain makes a person stronger.
132,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,I’m going to the battlefield. I won’t let this village and my brother be wasted!
133,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,I don’t want peace bought with Itachi’s life.
134,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"If I haven’t the courage to face this demon, how can I ever hope to face him?"
135,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"While it’s true I once desired destruction and the only goal I had was revenge, things are different now."
136,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"What I desire is to reform the entire shinobi world. What I am calling for, what I am bringing forth, is revolution."
137,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"I spared your life on a whim, nothing more. But this time, my whim is telling me to finish what I started."
138,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"They’re all laughing. You’re laughing at the cost of Itachi’s life laughing together, completely ignorant of everything."
139,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,No man chooses evil because it is evil; he only mistakes it for happiness—the good he seeks.
140,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"Just shut up for once! What the hell do you know about it? It’s not like you ever had a family in the first place! You were on your own right from the beginning, what makes you think you know anything about it? I’m suffering now because I had those ties. How on earth could you possibly understand what it feels like to lose all that?"
141,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,I see. I don’t even understand even one of these problems.
142,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,How could I lose to that freak?
143,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"If you want to ridicule me as a brat swayed by his emotions, go ahead."
144,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,Was she having fun in her little make-believe fantasy of true love?
145,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"Naruto, don’t let your dream die."
146,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"Instead of wasting all of that time chasing me, you should have been training."
147,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"Weaknesses? Listen, he was full of weaknesses. He was a good-for-nothing, but he pulled himself up with his own strength and became Hokage."
148,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,"You don’t need to understand who Naruto is now, you need to know the Naruto who made it all the way here."
149,Sasuke,Naruto,Sasuke,The soul of shinobi remains the same—even for your kid.
150,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"Even the most ignorant, innocent child will eventually grow up as they learn what true pain is. It affects what they say, what they think… and they become real people."
151,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"Too many people have died here, their pain is what helped me grow up."
152,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"How can you say that you will never change? That you will not change, no matter how great the pain you face? Can you continue believing in yourself forever? Can you guarantee it? Can you have such faith in yourself?"
153,Pain,Naruto,Pain,Learn to embrace the fear of feeling about what it’s like to contemplate what it is to know true pain.
154,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"We are but men, drawn to act in the name of revenge that we deem to be justice."
155,Pain,Naruto,Pain,Let me ask you this: How will you confront this hatred in order to create peace?
156,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"Just by living, people hurt others without even realizing it."
157,Pain,Naruto,Pain,Love breeds sacrifice… which in turn breeds hatred. Then you can know pain.
158,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"You think you’re the only ones who matter, You think you can put off death."
159,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"Religion, ideology, resources, land, spite, love or just because, No matter how pathetic the reason, it’s enough to start a war."
160,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"There is no such thing as real peace, It’s impossible as long as we live in this accursed world."
161,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"If there is justice in revenge, then that same justice will breed only more revenge and trigger a cycle of hatred.”"
162,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"Dying like trash, Never ending hatred, Pain that never heals, That is war, This is what we must face."
163,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"Just because you understand them doesn’t mean you can come to an agreement, That’s the truth.”"
164,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"Vengeance is the product of that hate and so death follows, But in death there is only more death."
165,Pain,Naruto,Pain,Justice comes from vengeance but justice only breeds more vengeance.”
166,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"If you don’t share the pain with someone, you will never understand the pain.”"
167,Pain,Naruto,Pain,Even children are forced to grow up in the face of pain.
168,Pain,Naruto,Pain,Human nature pursues strife.”
169,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"Pain Is The Only Way To Teach, Pain Is The Only Solution To Peace. If You Want To Know Pain, You Need To Understand Pain."

171,Pain,Naruto,Pain,"So Long As Humanity Exists, Hate Will Also Exist.”"
172,Pain,Naruto,Pain,Love is the reason why there is pain.
