</p>
<p>
    31. &#8220;I actually don&#8217;t think something like perfection exists. That
    is I think why we are born able to absorb things&#8230; and by comparing
    ourselves with something else we can finally head in a good direction.&#8221;
    &#8211; <strong>Itachi</strong>
</p>
<p>
    32. &#8220;No single thing is perfect by itself. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re
    born to attract other things to make up for what we lack.&#8221; &#8211;
    <strong>Itachi</strong>
</p>
<p>
    33. &#8220;I&#8217;ll admit that you&#8217;re stronger than before. But
    because of that, you seem to have lost sight of what&#8217;s truly important.
    Now listen carefully. The people of the village, who once abhorred you, have
    begun to admire you. They think of you as a comrade. It&#8217;s because you
    fought hard for their acceptance. You once said it was everyone who cares
    about you who helped you get where you are now. If you forget others because
    you have power, and become arrogant and egotistical, you&#8217;ll eventually
    become just like Madara. No matter how powerful you become, do not try to
    shoulder everything alone. Becoming the Hokage doesn&#8217;t mean people will
    acknowledge you. But when the people acknowledge you, you can become Hokage.
    Never forget your friends.&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Itachi</strong>
</p>
<p>
    34. &#8220;It&#8217;s never been &#8220;The one who becomes Hokage will be
    acknowledged by everyone&#8221;, it&#8217;s &#8220;The one who is acknowledged
    by everyone, becomes the Hokage&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Itachi</strong>
</p>
<p>
    35. &#8220;Self-sacrifice&#8230; A nameless shinobi who protects peace within
    its shadow. That is a true shinobi.&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Itachi</strong>
</p>
<p>36. &#8220;We are humans, not fish.” &#8211; <strong>Itachi</strong></p>
<p>
    37. &#8220;Those who cannot acknowledge themselves, will eventually
    fail.&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Itachi</strong>
</p>
<p>
    38. “People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true.
    That&#8217;s how they define &#8220;reality.” &#8211; <strong>Itachi</strong>
</p>
<p>
    39. &#8220;Obsessed with the organization, obsessed with the clan, obsessed
    with our lineage&#8230; A worthless compulsion that enslaves us and limits our
    capabilities, leading us to fear what you don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;
    &#8211; <strong>Itachi</strong>
